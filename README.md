"In 2024, I actively engaged in diverse opportunities to build my skills and explore my career interests. In February, I participated in the IIT Bombay Placement Preparation Session, 
     which enhanced my understanding of placement processes and strategies for excelling in technical and behavioral interviews. I also attended an industrial visit to 8 Queens Software Company, 
      gaining practical insights into software development and industry workflows. Additionally, I completed an AutoCAD 2D Workshop, where I honed my skills in drafting and designing technical layouts.
      With a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, I am focused on leveraging these experiences to build a robust foundation for a career in AI, combining technical expertise with industry awareness."
